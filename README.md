# Polys Protocol

Since we are a private company, we decided not to publish the Polys protocol code to open-source because it is a trade secret. However, we plan to publish documentation on the protocol and several tools so that everyone can check how it works and make sure of reliability of our system. We are also considering options for independent audit and publication of its results.
We are currently preparing migration from Parity blockchain client to Exonum framework. This will allow us to get much higher performance and implement powerful tools for end-to-end verification of voting process. Moreover, we are changing the encryption to a more modern and robust one, and implementing anonymization of voters using a blind signature, which makes the voting process even more secure.
